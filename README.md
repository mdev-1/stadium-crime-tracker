## üìù General notes

- I saw different rate limiting on the Police API than they have in their documentation. The documentation states a rate limit of 15 requests per second, with a burst of 30. In my testing I found 12 requests per second was generally reliable, however 13+ quite consistently gave me a 429. I implemented throttling in axios interceptors to handle this.
- I've supported all dates available from the Police API. It seemed to be undocumented but I found it provides the previous 3 years of data (i.e. 2018-04 to 2021-04).

## üìà To do & future feature ideas

- Update to TS and add models for data entities (i.e. Team, Stadium, Crime)
- General improvements to structure and design
- Add more tests inc. mocking APIs (you can only run a single client test currently with `npm test`)
- Make the client year selection dynamic (everything else should be already)
- More graceful error handling
- Feature idea: Analysis on data e.g. in months when a team lost more games at home were there more or less crimes?
- Consider adding caching layer as data won't change very often
